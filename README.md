**Sample HL7 Australia proof of concept implementation guide**

A sample, template-driven implementation guide for proof of concept guides -adapted from [sample-ig](https://github.com/FHIR/sample-ig). Provides a starting environment to use a base for defining these IGs.

Proof of concept implementation guides are known to HL7 Australia, and are exploring a problem space but will not directly be an HL7 Australian standard. The content in such an implementation guide may feed into the HL7 Australian standards process.
